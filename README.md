# plushu-eval-long-opt

A long-opt to perform an `eval` as part of command parsing.

As [eval is evil][], this plugin, like plushu-plushook-plugin and
plushu-env-var-opts, should never really be used. It's one of the biggest
footgun debugging plugins you can realistically install as part of your Plushu
ecosystem.
